# Cross-Section Generator Plugin for Fusion 360
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## Executive Summary

The Cross-Section Generator is a Fusion 360 script that automatically generates a series of cross-sectional sketches from user-selected bodies along specified axes. This tool addresses the common need for creating internal structural frameworks in complex geometries like airplane wings, boat hulls, and other curved or tapered designs where manual cross-sectioning is time-intensive and error-prone.

## Problem Statement

Current Fusion 360 workflows for creating cross-sectional views require users to manually:
- Create multiple construction planes at desired intervals
- Generate individual sketches by projecting body intersections onto each plane
- Manage and organize dozens of sketches across complex designs
- Iterate on spacing and positioning through repetitive manual processes

This manual approach is tedious, error-prone, and becomes increasingly complex as designs grow in sophistication. Users often need 10-50+ cross-sections for structural analysis and internal framework design.

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Hobbyist makers** building RC aircraft, boats, and complex mechanical projects
- **Engineering students** learning design principles and creating academic projects
- **Prototyping engineers** in aerospace, marine, and automotive industries

### User Personas

**"Alex the RC Builder"**
- Designs custom RC airplanes and boats
- Needs consistent cross-sections for internal ribs and frames
- Limited time for manual CAD work
- Values automation and repeatability

**"Sam the Student"**
- Mechanical/aerospace engineering student
- Working on capstone projects involving complex geometries
- Learning professional CAD workflows
- Needs to iterate quickly on designs

## Core Functionality

### Primary Features

**1. Body Selection**
- Multi-select capability for target bodies from current document
- Visual highlighting of all selected geometries
- Support for both solid and surface bodies
- Clear indication of selection count in UI

**2. Axis Configuration**
- Native Fusion 360 axis selector control (consistent with standard tools)
- Limited to X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis options for initial release
- Visual axis indicator in viewport
- Automatic detection of body bounds along selected axis

**3. Cross-Section Definition**
- **Count-based spacing**: User specifies number of sections, plugin calculates even spacing across all selected bodies
- **Distance-based spacing**: User specifies interval distance, plugin calculates section count based on combined bounds

**4. Cross-Section Generation**
- Automatic creation of new component for organization
- Generation of individual sketches at each cross-section position for each selected body
- Proper sketch naming convention indicating body and section (e.g., "Body1_Section_001", "Body2_Section_001")
- Consolidated sketches at each plane position when multiple bodies intersect

**5. Post-Generation Editing**
- Each cross-section sketch attached to parametric offset plane
- Users can adjust individual section positions via standard "Edit Feature" workflow
- Modified sections automatically regenerate sketch geometry for all selected bodies
- Maintains associativity with all original bodies for design updates

### Secondary Features

**6. Organization & Management**
- Component-based organization at document level for all plugin-generated objects (offset planes, sketches, construction geometry)
- Logical naming conventions for easy identification of generated elements
- Timeline integration for easy modification history

**7. Export Options**
- Export section profiles as DXF files
- Generate technical drawings of sections

## User Experience Flow

### Primary Workflow
1. User selects multiple target bodies in design workspace
2. User launches Cross-Section Generator from Scripts and Add-ins > Scripts menu
3. Script dialog opens with bodies pre-selected
4. User configures:
   - Axis direction using native axis selector (X/Y/Z only)
   - Section definition method (count vs. spacing)
   - Number of sections or spacing distance
5. OK button enables once all required parameters are valid
6. User clicks "Generate" to create cross-sections
7. Script creates new component with parametric offset planes and associated sketches for all selected bodies
8. Script dialog automatically closes upon completion
9. User can later modify individual section positions using standard Fusion 360 "Edit Feature" on offset planes
10. Modified sketches automatically regenerate to reflect new positions for all bodies

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages for invalid selections
- Graceful handling of complex geometry edge cases
- Undo functionality for generated components

```

**Branching Strategy:**
- `main`: Stable, tested releases
- `develop`: Integration branch for new features
- `feature/*`: Individual feature development
- `hotfix/*`: Critical bug fixes for releases

## Success Criteria

### Deployment & Installation
- **Script Installation**: User can successfully copy script files to Fusion 360 Scripts directory
- **Script Discovery**: Script appears in Scripts and Add-ins > Scripts menu with proper naming
- **First Launch**: Script launches without errors on first execution
- **Dependencies**: Script runs on standard Fusion 360 installation without additional Python packages

### Core Functionality
- **Body Selection**: Script correctly identifies and processes 1-10+ selected bodies of various types (solid, surface)
- **Parameter Validation**: All input combinations (axis selection, count/distance modes, quantity ranges) work correctly
- **Cross-Section Generation**: Generated sketches accurately represent body intersections at specified positions
- **Parametric Behavior**: Offset planes remain editable via "Edit Feature" and sketches regenerate properly
- **Component Organization**: All generated elements (planes, sketches) are properly organized in dedicated component

### Design Workflow Integration
- **Selection Workflow**: Script works with pre-selected bodies and maintains selection state appropriately  
- **Timeline Integration**: Generated features appear properly in timeline and can be suppressed/unsuppressed
- **Undo Capability**: Script operations can be undone using Fusion 360's standard undo (Ctrl+Z)
- **Component Management**: Generated components can be renamed, hidden, or deleted without breaking parent design
- **Design Updates**: Original body modifications properly propagate to generated cross-section sketches

### User Experience & Error Handling
- **Clean Cancellation**: User can cancel script dialog without side effects or partial generation
- **Error Recovery**: Script handles invalid geometry, empty intersections, and edge cases gracefully
- **Progress Feedback**: User receives appropriate feedback during processing of complex/multiple bodies
- **Clean Exit**: Script terminates properly without requiring manual cleanup
- **Application Shutdown**: Fusion 360 closes normally without script-related prompts or hanging processes

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Small Models**: 5 cross-sections on simple geometry completes in <5 seconds
- **Complex Models**: 20 cross-sections on aircraft wing/boat hull geometry completes in <30 seconds  
- **Memory Management**: Script processes large models without memory leaks or performance degradation
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple bodies processed efficiently without exponential time increase

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: UI Prototype
**Objective**: Validate user interface design and parameter collection before implementing geometry processing

**Deliverables:**
- Complete UI dialog matching the mockup design
- Input validation for all parameters
- Parameter collection and validation logic
- Mock output via message box displaying collected parameters
- No actual geometry generation in this phase

**Benefits:**
- Rapid iteration on UI design and user experience
- Early feedback on parameter validation logic
- Foundation for full implementation
- Risk mitigation by validating approach before complex geometry work

### Phase 2: Full Implementation
**Objective**: Add geometry processing capabilities to the validated UI

**Deliverables:**
- Replace mock output with actual cross-section generation
- Implement parametric offset plane creation
- Add sketch generation and body intersection logic
- Component organization and naming
- Error handling for complex geometry cases

## Script vs Add-in Decision

**Recommendation: Script**

**Justification:**
- **Usage Pattern**: Tool used once or twice during design process, not continuously
- **No Persistent UI**: No need for toolbar icons or permanent interface elements
- **Clean Shutdown**: Scripts automatically terminate after execution, no cleanup required when closing Fusion 360
- **Simplicity**: Lighter architecture without event handling for persistent state
- **User Experience**: Accessed via Scripts menu when needed, doesn't clutter the main UI

**Script Characteristics:**
- Single execution model - runs, completes task, terminates
- No persistent background processes
- Accessed via Scripts and Add-ins > Scripts menu
- Automatically handles cleanup and resource management
- Ideal for task-oriented tools like cross-section generation
